## 1. What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?
This project was incredibly enjoyable for me, as I was able to create a website effectively for the first time. I have some questions about the footer because every time I resize the screen, it doesn’t stay in place. I also managed to use some JavaScript functions that I learned in the last two lectures, along with other operations that required me to rely on external sources, especially AI-supported websites. Visual Studio undoubtedly helped me complete the design automatically, and I then modified the code based on the wireframe I envisioned using VSG Repo.

## 2. How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?
Initially, I expected that creating a website with these requirements would be quick and take about two hours. However, I found that it took me the entire day for two main reasons: First, I wanted the site to be error-free, and second, my work environment wasn’t ideal, and I couldn’t dedicate all my time to it. Nevertheless, I’m really happy with the outcome, and I feel proud that I’ve built a simple and effective website. Next time, I’ll be able to manage my time better, work faster, and achieve even better performance.
